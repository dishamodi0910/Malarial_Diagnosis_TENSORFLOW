# Malarial Diagnosis using TensorFlow

We will give the blood report and it will detect whether it has malaria or not(Parasited or Uninfected)
We will be dealing with image data throughout. And as it is the problem and we have to say whether it is a parasited or not, so it is <b> binary classification problem</b>

Malaria Dataset = [dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/malaria)
